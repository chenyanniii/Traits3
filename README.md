# PhyloCompareTraits_Shiny

Shiny is a web framework for displaying data. This shiny app is developed based on a phylogenetic comparative study of ecological restoration desired species. The aim of this app is to allow restoration practitioners, who are not familiar with phylogenetic tools, to explore our phylogenetic analysis.

The default input data and methods are described in the manuscript of  "Including Phylogenetic Conservatism of Shortgrass Prairie Restoration Desired Species Does Not  Improve Species Germination Prediction"

Users can interactively calculate all parameters for any sub-pools of species that users choose using checkboxes. Users are able to investigate the impact of species choice on the phylogenetic signal and germination prediction.
